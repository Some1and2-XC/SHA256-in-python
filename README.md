# SHA256 in python3 ** [ 2021 ] **
## Implimentation
 - This implimentation was both inspired and created because of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9EbD6iY9zI). 
 - This implimentation is **non-functional**, I couldn't get the K0 constant in the compression step to be set correctly however the function does still give output so isn't completely useless. However the output will be different from a truly faithful SHA256 implimentation.
